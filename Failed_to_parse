[WARNING]:  * Failed to parse /runner/inventory/hosts with yaml plugin: We were
unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)  Syntax Error while loading
YAML.   did not find expected key  The error appears to be in
'/runner/inventory/hosts': line 3, column 55, but may be elsewhere in the file
depending on the exact syntax problem.  The offending line appears to be:  #
-*- coding: utf-8 -*- print('{"all": {"hosts": [], "children": ["GRUPO"]},
"_meta": {"hostvars": {}}}')
^ here We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
unbalanced quotes. If starting a value with a quote, make sure the line ends
with the same set of quotes. For instance this arbitrary example:      foo:
"bad" "wolf"  Could be written as:      foo: '"bad" "wolf"'
